**Welcome to the world of tournament brackets reinvented with Google Sheets!**

Managing tournament brackets can be notoriously challenging. Handwritten brackets necessitate rewriting names, erasing and correcting mistakes, and dealing with a plethora of papers and posters. This Google Sheets template offers a delightfully simple, customizable, and efficient solution for managing tournament brackets, whether it’s in a classroom setting or a community sports event.

## Key Features:
- **Checkboxes to Indicate Winners:** Just a single click to update the brackets.
- **Customizable Bracket Design:** Customize the appearance to fit the theme and aesthetic of your tournament.
- **Single and Double Elimination Templates:** The sheet provides templates for both single and double-elimination tournaments.
- **Participant Randomization and Easy Resetting:** Randomize participant orders and effortlessly reset the sheet for new tournaments.
- **Streamlined Tournament Management:** Advances winners based on checkboxes and manages conditional matches.
- **Cell Protection:** Warns users attempting to edit protected cells and helps maintain the integrity of the sheet.
- **No Subscription or Privacy Worries:** The tool is free to use and fully customizable.

## Instructions:

1. Open the template preview of the Single & Double-Elimination Brackets Sheet.
2. Click on the ‘USE TEMPLATE‘ button in the top-right corner of your sheet.
3. Choose your tournament type: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, or 16.
    - Sheets with ‘s’ after the number are single-elimination tournaments.
    - Do not change the sheet names, as the script relies on them to run.
4. Enter the names of the participants in Column A, starting with cell A2.
5. Pick the order, or click the ‘randomize order‘ button for random matchups.

## Background
The design concept began by using cell borders to create the tournament bracket lines on which to write player names and guide the rounds of elimination. The Google Sheets tool advances winners to the next round through cell formulas and functions, and checkboxes were used to indicate winners. The entire process was greatly simplified with the help of Google Apps Script and ChatGPT.

This tool represents a beta version and is continuously evolving. I'm excited to share it with fellow tournament enthusiasts, educators, and tech-savvy individuals who appreciate efficiency, accuracy, and user-friendly experiences. Your feedback and suggestions will be invaluable for refining and enhancing this tool.
